Shuttle is meant as a CLI utility that allows a developer to quickly manage the following tasks:

- View Docker Image for each Pod in Kubernetes Cluster
- View available Docker images in Goolge Cloud Registry
- Swap out Docker image in pod with image in Cloud Registry
- Swap out entire cluster to a reference a particular SHA1 hash (works well if all images are built together or for small number of images)
